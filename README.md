# MudBot
This is a basic MUD client chatbot for Slack.
You can add MudBot to your favorite Slack-channel and talk to him to play your favorite Multi-User Dungeon.

## Controls
Once you're connected to a MUD, you can easily disconnect from it by typing 'escaped' commands:
```
[DISCONNECT]
```

When you want to send a carriage return to the MUD itself you can do so by typing:
```
[ENTER]
```


## Installation

```
echo "export export SLACKBOT_TOKEN=<insert your token here>" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
