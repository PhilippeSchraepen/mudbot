# MudBot
This is a very basic MUD client chatbot.

What that means for now is that you can add MudBot to your favorite Slack-channel and talk to him to play your favorite Multi-User Dungeon.

## Installation

```
echo "export export SLACKBOT_TOKEN=<insert your token here>" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```
